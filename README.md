# Exploratory-data-analysis-and-risk-profiling
This repository contains code and documentation for a project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Risk Profiling using GenAI-powered tools. The project aims to identify potential credit delinquency risks by analyzing a dataset and developing a risk profile.

**Contents:**

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) code and visualizations
- Risk profiling methodology and results
- GenAI-powered tool integration for data analysis and insight generation
- Documentation and reports detailing the analysis and findings

**Technologies Used:**

- Python (or other programming languages used)
- GenAI-powered tools ( specify the tools used)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Goals:**

- Conduct thorough EDA to understand the dataset and identify patterns
- Develop a risk profile to predict credit delinquency risks
- Leverage GenAI-powered tools to enhance data analysis and insight generation
